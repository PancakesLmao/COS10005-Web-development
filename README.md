# Purpose of the assignment
<p>It is an individual assignment that provides an opportunity to practice
again techniques and skills involved in designing webpages using HTML5 and CSS. JavaScript will be
used to validate user input data before they are submitted to the server for processing. Moreover,
JavaScript will be used to add more interactivity to the webpages.</p>


> At this stage, I was quite new to web dev so the code appears to be clumsy, unstructured. This was also my first time using Javascript and i couldn't distinguise between traditional Javascript and jQuery which is why the js file is mixed (looks cursed...). In the future, I'll try to enchance the UI responsiveness and more user-friendlier, also seperating each components into individual files so the folder looks more structured when working with a team.
