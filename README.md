> At this stage, I was quite new to web dev so the code appears to be clumsy, unstructured. This was also my first time using Javascript and i couldn't distinguise between traditional Javascript and jQuery which is why the js file is mixed (looks cursed...). In the future, I'll try to enchance the UI responsiveness and more user-friendlier, also seperating each components into individual files so the folder looks more structured when working with a team.
